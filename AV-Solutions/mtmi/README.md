# Multi-task model inference on multiple devices
## Introduction
This application is to demostrate the deployment of a multi-task network on NVIDIA Drive Orin platform. 
To improve latency and throughput, we leveraging different compute devices(GPU and DLA) on the SoC with CUDA, TensorRT and cuDLA. To better utilize all the compute resources, we decided to run encoder in FP16 on GPU, depth decoder in INT8 on DLA0 and segmentation decoder in INT8 on DLA1.\

The schedule of the tasks are pipelined to pursue higher throughput with low overhead. When DLA0 and DLA1 are working on previous frame, we can launch the encoder for the current frame on GPU at the same time. So the executation is overlapped.\

## Prepare onnx models
The original onnx model has been exported from a trained model. It's a multi-task network with Mix Transformer encoders(MiT) B0 as backbone. This backbone was originally used in [SegFormer](https://github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer). And for the segmentation head, it's a slim version of SegFormer-B0. For depth head, it was a progressive decoder orignally from [DEST](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring22-s41429/). 

### Prerequisite
You may install dependencies with 
```bash
pip install onnx onnxruntime onnx-graphsurgeon onnxsim
```

We also provided some onnx files containing random weights to help you go through the following process. You can download these files into `onnx_files/`. For real use case, we encourage users to train their own models with backbone and heads of their choice in order to generate meaningful inference results in the end.

| onnx | download links |
|------| -------------- |
| whole network | [mtmi.onnx](https://github.com/jin-yc10/storage/releases/download/mtmi/mtmi.onnx) |
| simplified whole network | [mtmi_slim.onnx](https://github.com/jin-yc10/storage/releases/download/mtmi/mtmi_slim.onnx) |
| image encoder | [mtmi_encoder.onnx](https://github.com/jin-yc10/storage/releases/download/mtmi/mtmi_encoder.onnx) |
| depth head | [mtmi_depth_head.onnx](https://github.com/jin-yc10/storage/releases/download/mtmi/mtmi_depth_head.onnx) |
| segmentation head | [mtmi_seg_head.onnx](https://github.com/jin-yc10/storage/releases/download/mtmi/mtmi_seg_head.onnx) |

Step1: Simplify the onnx file. This is to manipulate the onnx graph, remove redundant nodes, do constant folding etc. For more detail about the simplification, you may refer to [daquexian/onnx-simplifier](https://github.com/daquexian/onnx-simplifier)
```bash
python tools/onnx_simplify.py
```

Step2: Split the onnx model into encoder, depth decoder and semantic segmentation decoder. Since encoder, depth and segmentation heads are assigned to different device, we also split the whole onnx graph into 3 sub-graphs and handle them separately.
```bash
python tools/onnx_split.py
```

## Post-training quantization

To better utilize DLA, we should use Int8. 
In order to obtain scale information, we utilize tensorrt calibration apis.

### Prepare intermediate features for calibration
We first use onnxruntime to produce intermediate features shared by the two decoders. And these features will be cached for next steps.
```bash
python tools/batch_preprocessing_onnx.py --onnx=PATH_TO_ONNX --image_path=PATH_TO_IMAGE_FILES --output_path=PATH_TO_SAVE_INTERMEDIATE_FEATURES
```

### Perform Post-training quantization
Then we can load from the cached feature map as input, and feed them into calibators.
With default arguments, you will get the calibration file under `calibration/`.

```bash
python tools/create_calibration_cache.py --onnx=PATH_TO_HEAD_ONNX --image-path=PATH_TO_IMAGE_FILES --output-path=PATH_TO_SAVE_ENGINES --cache-path=PATH_TO_SAVE_CALIBRATION_FILES
```

In order to achieve best INT8 resize perf on DLA, we carefully change the I/O scale manually for segmentation head while keeping the accuracy. TensorRT will choose a better DLA kernel with modified scales.

## Build TensorRT engine and DLA loadables using the calibration caches
On NVIDIA Drive Orin platform:

Build engine with "outputIOFormats=fp16:chw32" for MIT-b0 encoder:
```bash
trtexec --onnx=onnx_files/mtmi_encoder.onnx \
        --fp16 \
        --saveEngine=engines/mtmi_encoder_fp16.engine \
        --outputIOFormats=fp16:chw32 \
        --verbose
```

Build DLA loadable with "inputIOFormats=int8:chw32" and "outputIOFormats=int8:dla_linear" for depth decoder and semantic segmentation decoder onnx model.
```bash
trtexec --onnx=onnx_files/mtmi_depth_head.onnx \
        --int8 \
        --saveEngine=loadables/mtmi_depth_i8_dla.loadable \
        --useDLACore=0 \
        --inputIOFormats=int8:chw32 \
        --outputIOFormats=int8:dla_linear \
        --buildOnly \
        --verbose \
        --buildDLAStandalone \
        --calib=calibration/calibration_cache_depth.bin

trtexec --onnx=onnx_files/mtmi_seg_head.onnx \
        --int8 \
        --saveEngine=loadables/mtmi_seg_i8_dla.loadable \
        --useDLACore=1 \
        --inputIOFormats=int8:chw32 \
        --outputIOFormats=int8:dla_linear \
        --buildOnly \
        --verbose \
        --buildDLAStandalone \
        --calib=calibration/calibration_cache_seg_mod.bin
```

## Build and run inference app
The inference app is designed as the following steps:
1. Initialization
2. For each round
    1. load next image, if no more image, move to the first one
    2. preprocess
    3. run backbone on gpu
    4. quantize the feature map
    5. run depth head on dla0, and run segmentation head on dla1 at the same time.
    6. if last round, dump output data to results/ for visualization
3. cleanup and exit

### Build the app
In this section, we will cross compile the application on x86 for NVIDIA Drive Orin platform.

Docker: nvcr.io/drive-priority/driveos-pdk/drive-agx-orin-linux-aarch64-pdk-build-x86:6.0.8.1-0006.
Launch docker with 
```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --network=host --rm -v DL4AGX_DIR:/DL4AGX nvcr.io/drive-priority/driveos-pdk/drive-agx-orin-linux-aarch64-pdk-build-x86:6.0.8.1-0006
```
Inside the docker, you can run:
```bash
cd /DL4AGX/mtmi/inference_app
sh build.sh
```
And you will get the executable file at `/DL4AGX/mtmi/inference_app/build/orin/mtmiapp`

### Run the app
Please make sure you have the following files on NVIDIA Drive Orin platform.
```yaml
engines/
  mtmi_depth_i8_dla.loadable
  mtmi_encoder_fp16.engine
  mtmi_seg_i8_dla.loadable
results/  # folder to hold result data
tests/
  1.png   # input images, must crop to 1024x1024
  ...
mtmiapp   # the demo app
```

Then run the demo with
```bash
$ ./mtmiapp
```

Sample logs:
```
...
loop: 1 backbone elapsed: 29.799711 chrono elapsed: 29.965000
...
```

### Visualize results
Run the following python scripts to obtain visualization results from dumped binary result data.
```
python tools/visualize.py
```
Then you will get image results in `results/`
![result](./results/5.png)
